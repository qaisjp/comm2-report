\abstract{
    In this project we discuss, design and implement a resource sharing website for the game MTA: San Andreas. \emph{Resources} are essentially modular packages containing scripts, assets and metadata that change way the game behaves.

    We performed a brief security and user experience analysis of the existing community platform, suggested several improvements to the existing system, and incorporated these changes into a prototype of an improved system.
