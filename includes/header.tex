\abstract{
    There is a rich ecosystem of ``resources'' (essentially software packages) built for the game MTA: San Andreas and this project aims to create a new
    community platform "MTA Hub" for users to safely share, vote on and discuss these resources. This project aims to replace the existing community platform, improve
    on the old system in several ways, and build a better system overall.

    % TODO: make clear what is new on the platform. Explain why it's better, not just similar.
    Content authors are able to collaborate on resources with others, and also able to promote other related assets (websites, videos and screenshots).

    Content moderators are able to review resources as they are submitted and are also encouraged by the system to make moderation decisions via several heuristics,
    ensuring that the platform hosts high quality resources with no malicious intent.

    Platform administrators are able to appoint moderators with gradular access control, allowing some users to manage other users, or to act as content moderators.

    The existing internationalisation feature is replaced
