# Successful websites and their APIs {#sec:bg-api-analysis}

In this section we analyse a number of successful websites and their APIs. Some of these are software repositories, but not necessarily all of them.

We discuss a number of the following features for each site:

- **API** Does the website have an API?
    - **Architecture.** Is the API and/or website RESTful? What is the URL scheme like?
    - **Use of public APIs.** Does it use its own public API?
- **Public access?** Does the API and/or website allow public access?
- **PWA.** Is the website a progressive web application?
- **Naming / scoping.** How does the system handle name clashes?

Decisions throughout this report will call back to these discussions.

## github.com

GitHub has two main APIs, [REST API v3] and [GraphQL API v4], in addition to supporting "[webhooks](https://developer.github.com/webhooks/)".

Their documentation describes why GitHub uses GraphQL[^why-graphql]:

> GitHub chose GraphQL for our API v4 because it offers significantly more flexibility for our integrators. The ability to define precisely the data you want—and only the data you want—is a powerful advantage over the REST API v3 endpoints. GraphQL lets you replace multiple REST requests with a single call to fetch the data you specify.

[REST API v3]: https://developer.github.com/v3/
[GraphQL API v4]: https://developer.github.com/v4/
