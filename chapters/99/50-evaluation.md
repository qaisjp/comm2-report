# Testing

The technologies used in this project were carefully chosen to support automated testing. The backend supports testing via Go's inbuilt testing infrastructure (`go test`). Every component on the frontend has a test file,  automatically generated via the `ng generate` command, ready for manual expansion by contributors.

# Stakeholders

The new platform currently only caters to scripters and does not take into account enough of the needs of some of the other stakeholders. TODO.

# User Experience

MTA Hub includes many quality of life improvements, making it more pleasing to use than the existing system.

Every page of MTA Hub is built mobile-first, is responsive, and supports all screen sizes. The existing system, however, does not have any responsive pages and only supports a large desktop screen size.

MTA Hub has improved accessibility and achieves this by using `aria-*` attributes wherever necessary. The existing system does not take into account accessibility at all.

# User Testing

Due to the COVID-19 crisis we have been unable to perform user testing.
