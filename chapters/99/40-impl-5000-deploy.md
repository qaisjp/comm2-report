# Deployment {#sec:deployment}

Deployment is an important part of creating a web platform â€” merely building an application is insufficient, it should be easy to deploy locally (for development) as well as to deploy in production. A web application that is difficult to deploy has the following issues:

- badly maintained, since new developers are unable to pick up the project and start hacking immediately
- slow development, because existing developers have to train new developers on how to get started, or write tricky documentation

## Development (local) {#sec:deployment-dev}


## Production (remote) {#sec:deployment-prod}

The same Docker image created in [@sec:deployment-dev] can be used in production. This keeps the development environment as close to the production environment as possible.
