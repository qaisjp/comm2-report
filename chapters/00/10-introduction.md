- Chapter 2 discusses and analyses the existing platform, existing package management websites (software repositories), and existing API-driven websites.
- Chapter 3 explains and discusses initial project setup and the initial (design) decisions that went into building MTA Hub.
- Chapter 4 explores the challenges in implementing MTA Hub, discusses further design decisions, and explains how features were introduced.
- Chapter 5 evaluates the platform in terms of speed, whether it satisfies the non-functional requirements, and summarises user feedback.
- Chapter 6 concludes the work completed and outlines potential future extensions.

# Terminology {#sec:terminology}

The terminology used throughout this report has been chosen carefully as to not be ambiguous, but may not apply when referring to other systems.

- `resource`: a collection of assets (scripts, images, models, audio files) â€” "partly equivalent to a program running in an operating system" [@ResourcesMultiTheft]

    A resource can be of the following types [@lyonsedwinMetaXmlMulti2008]:

    - `gamemode` - provides core game mechanics
    - `map` - a collection of game world objects, allowing for unique twists on the core mechanics provided by gamemodes
    - `script` - may provide extra features that interact gamemodes
    - `misc` - utility resources
- `package`: a particular version of a resource, when differentiating between versions is important
- `server`: an instance of the game server (which can run many resources)

These terms describe the stakeholders:

- maintainers:
    - `moderator`: someone that issues bans or reviews content, keeping the platform safe
    - `administrator`: a moderator that also manages user permissions
    - `sysadmin`: an administrator that deploys and has full access to the platform
    - `contributor`: someone who contributes code to this project (does not necessarily have special permissions)
- users:
    - `scripter`: someone that authors _resources_
    - `mapper`: someone that primarily creates _resources_ of the _map_ type
    - `server owner`: a user that manages a `server` but is not necessarily technical (does not have to be a `scripter` or `mapper`)
    - `player`: a user that connects to a `server` and interacts with _resources_
