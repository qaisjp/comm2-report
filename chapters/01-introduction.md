# Terminology

Terminology throughout this report is chosen carefully as to not be ambiguous. These terms may not apply when referring to other systems. These terms also describe the stakeholders.

- `resource`: a collection of assets (scripts, images, models, audio files) â€” "partly equivalent to a program running in an operating system" [^what-is-a-resource]
- `package`: a particular version of a resource, when differentiating between versions is important
- (of the platform)
    - `maintainer`: someone who contributes code to this project (does not necessarily have special permissions)
    - `sysadmin`: a super administrator that deploys and has full access to the platform
    - `moderator` or `reviewer`: someone that issues bans or reviews content, keeping the platform safe
- `server`: an instance of the game server (which can run many resources)
- `scripter`: someone that authors _resources_
- `mapper`: someone that authors _resources_ of the `map` type
- `server owner`: a user that manages a `server` but is not necessarily technical (does not have to be a `scripter` or `mapper`)
- `player`: a user that connects to a `server` and enjoys experiences offered by `resources`
