# Terminology

The terminology used throughout this report has been chosen carefully as to not be ambiguous, but may not apply when referring to other systems. These terms also describe the stakeholders.

- `resource`: a collection of assets (scripts, images, models, audio files) â€” "partly equivalent to a program running in an operating system" [^what-is-a-resource]
- `package`: a particular version of a resource, when differentiating between versions is important
- (of the platform)
    - `maintainer`: someone who contributes code to this project (does not necessarily have special permissions)
    - `sysadmin`: a super administrator that deploys and has full access to the platform
    - `moderator` or `reviewer`: someone that issues bans or reviews content, keeping the platform safe
- `server`: an instance of the game server (which can run many resources)
- `scripter`: someone that authors _resources_
- `mapper`: someone that authors _resources_ of the `map` type
- `server owner`: a user that manages a `server` but is not necessarily technical (does not have to be a `scripter` or `mapper`)
- `player`: a user that connects to a `server` and enjoys experiences offered by `resources`
