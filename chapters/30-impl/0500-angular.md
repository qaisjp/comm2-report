# Angular

This section describes the high-level design and implementation of our Angular frontend.

## Logging

Logging was done via https://www.codemag.com/Article/1711021/Logging-in-Angular-Applications


## Dates and Times

generate "ago" strings using https://www.npmjs.com/package/ngx-moment

Postgresql timezones - we set the database timezone to UTC, and we don’t use timezone specific timestamps. All dates are generated by the database (dates aren’t inserted anywhere) - so problem is solved!

## Templates

use ng-container https://stackoverflow.com/a/41235052/1517394 for bare if statements

template variables single assignment https://stackoverflow.com/a/40751358/1517394
