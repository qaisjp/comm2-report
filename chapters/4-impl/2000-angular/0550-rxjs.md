## RxJS

Angular has comprehensive support for RxJS, which is "a library for reactive programming using Observables, to make it easier to compose asynchronous or callback-based code" [@RxJS].

> "Observables provide support for passing messages between parts of your application. They are used frequently in Angular and are the recommended technique for event handling, asynchronous programming, and handling multiple values." [@AngularUsingObservables]

See @lst:complex-rxjs-result of [@sec:8500-pkg-upload] for our most complex use of the RxJS library.

**Promises vs. Observables**

Both a `Promise` and `Observable` "provide us with abstractions that help us deal with the asynchronous nature of our applications" [@AngularWhatDifferencea], but the primary difference is that a "`Promise` handles a single event when an \[asynchronous\] operation \[successfully\] completes or fails" [@AngularWhatDifference].

We chose to use observables as they also provide the following additional features:

- Cancellation. Expressive subscriptions such as HTTP requests can be cancelled when we navigate to another page. This improves our performance.
- A unified API "to handle 0, 1, or multiple events" [@AngularWhatDifference], making it easier to write code.
- Tight integration with the Angular framework.
- RxJS provides a functional API and a function `pipe()` that allows us to mutate results and react to responses effectively.
