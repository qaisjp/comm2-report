# Database

Postgresql timezones - we set the database timezone to UTC, and we don’t use timezone specific timestamps. All dates are generated by the database (dates aren’t inserted anywhere) - so problem is solved!

`select r.* from resources r, resource_collaborators c where (r.author_id = 2) or ((r.id = c.resource_id and c.user_id = 2) and c.accepted)` was not DISTINCT. Because each `r.author_id` was being calculated for the cross product of r and c. Ust SELECT DISTINCT for fix. Was 12 rows, now 6.https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18988467/sql-query-returning-duplicate-rows





version history - we initially had a `draft` field realised that we wanted to sort different based on published at. so we got rid of `draft` and had a `published_at` nullable field. "The SQL standard does not explicitly define a default sort order for Nulls" - https://knowledgebase.progress.com/articles/Article/How-to-control-the-sort-order-for-NULL-values-with-the-DataServer - we discovered!!! we found that we could use `ORDER BY DESC NULLS FIRST`. and multiple `order by` clauses on one. so we can float unpublished to the top (and sort those by when they were most recently updated), and sort all the published ones by their publish date descending (rather than the date they were updated). one problem we encountered in the draft refactor was that we had to change our conditional inserts - https://github.com/Masterminds/squirrel/issues/239#issuecomment-603479602 - we had columns(...., “draft”) values(...., input.Draft0. Now we had to find a way to insert NULL if draft was true, and to insert the current time if draft was false. The first half is easy, we just use a pq.NullTime{} object. But for the second bit we don’t want to generate that time client-side or even in the backend API, because the API in some odd scenarios could be in a different timezone than the SQL server. Or the time could have drifted a bit. We use the about squirrel link to set the value based on an expression. sq.Expr(“now()”).
Then we use https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.5/dml-returning.html returning data from modified rows to get that ID and date afterwards



# Resource View

use a specific service for ResourceViewService https://stackoverflow.com/a/41451466/1517394

now only owners have access to serious admin operations, which is an improvement over everyone having equal access. this is much more important now that resources are namespaced under their creators username.

# Reactive Forms

also kind of unrelated but can you talk about ReactiveForms a bit?


# User Interface, UX and Responsiveness

Show profile resources page - xl, lg and super small

UX feature: create resource interface will match name and title when you type into "name", but once you start typing into Title, it will no longer sync the values.

ux - only show private/public indicator if viewing a page where you can view that sort of stuff (if you are viewing own page. or if you are admin)

Uploading a new version is on the resource page - and not hidden in the same place as uploading a resource itself

Resource descriptions. UX truncate pipe https://stackoverflow.com/a/44669515/1517394 - Ultimately decided to let users control this by just taking the first line of the description.

`.form-group-header > label` uses display block - this ensures good UX and allows the user click anywhere on the line of the label to select the edit box

### Rich Text

In the existing system, scripters can only insert plain text into their resource description. This makes it difficult for them to market their resource as scripters are unable to format text, include links, lists or embed images. To solve this issue we chose to render the resource description as Markdown.

Markdown is an "easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format" [@DaringFireballMarkdown] supported by most software-hosting websites, including the websites we analysed in [@sec:bg-api-analysis]: Npm Registry, Rust Package Registry and GitHub.

Resource descriptions are stored in plaintext in database using the `text` SQL type and rendered on the frontend using the `ngx-markdown` package^[ngx-markdown package: https://www.npmjs.com/package/ngx-markdown].
