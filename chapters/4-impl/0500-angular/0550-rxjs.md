## RxJS

Angular has comprehensive support for RxJS, which is "a library for reactive programming using Observables, to make it easier to compose asynchronous or callback-based code" [@RxJS].

> "Observables provide support for passing messages between parts of your application. They are used frequently in Angular and are the recommended technique for event handling, asynchronous programming, and handling multiple values." [@AngularUsingObservables]
