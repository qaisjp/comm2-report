# User Interface, UX and Responsiveness

Show profile resources page - xl, lg and super small

UX feature: create resource interface will match name and title when you type into "name", but once you start typing into Title, it will no longer sync the values.

ux - only show private/public indicator if viewing a page where you can view that sort of stuff (if you are viewing own page. or if you are admin)

Resource descriptions. UX truncate pipe https://stackoverflow.com/a/44669515/1517394 - Ultimately decided to let users control this by just taking the first line of the description.

responsive - u/2/hedit/manage is responsive

date text should take wide enough space - version history - https://stackoverflow.com/a/40389147/1517394
