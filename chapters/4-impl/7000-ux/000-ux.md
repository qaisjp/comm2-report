# User Interface & User Experience

## Profile

The profile page shown in [@fig:v-blankslate] has not published any resources. To improve UX, instead of a blank page, we chose to use Primer's "BlankSlate" component to display a button that prompts the user to create their first resource.

## Create a resource

On the "Create a resource" page shown in [@fig:v-createres], when the user types into the _Name_ field, their input is automatically copied into the _Title_ field. This is a sensible default and many users don't change the title of their resource.

To avoid user confusion, we only automatically copy the text from the _Name_ field into the _Title_ field if the user has not manually entered text into the _Title_ field. This ensures that the user's title is not overwritten if they change the _Name_ field after typing into the _Title_ field.

LONG BIO WORD BREAKING - overflow-wrap vs word-break - https://tympanus.net/codrops/css_reference/word-wrap/ - i chose `word-break: break-word` because we want it to prefer to break between words if possible (long bio - see jusonex)

Uploading a new version is on the resource page - and not hidden in the same place as uploading a resource itself

Resource descriptions. UX truncate pipe https://stackoverflow.com/a/44669515/1517394 - Ultimately decided to let users control this by just taking the first line of the description.

`.form-group-header > label` uses display block - this ensures good UX and allows the user click anywhere on the line of the label to select the edit box

### Resource About Page

In the existing system, scripters can only insert plain text into their resource description. This makes it difficult for them to market their resources as scripters are unable to format text, include links, lists or embed images. To solve this issue we chose to render the resource description as Markdown.

Markdown is an "easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format" [@DaringFireballMarkdown] supported by most software-hosting websites, including the websites we analysed in [@sec:bg-api-analysis]: Npm Registry, Rust Package Registry and GitHub.

Resource descriptions are stored in plaintext in database using the `text` SQL type and rendered on the frontend using the `ngx-markdown` package^[ngx-markdown package: https://www.npmjs.com/package/ngx-markdown].

Figure [-@fig:v-res-md-p] shows how a resource's about page is rendered, and [@fig:v-res-md-e] displays the edit interface.



## CSS Flex

We use the CSS `flex` property to change how many columns are displayed at different screen sizes.

### Profile
