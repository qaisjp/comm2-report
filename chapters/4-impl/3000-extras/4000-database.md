# Database

TODO

Postgresql timezones - we set the database timezone to UTC, and we don’t use timezone specific timestamps. All dates are generated by the database (dates aren’t inserted anywhere) - so the problem is solved!

`select r.* from resources r, resource_collaborators c where (r.author_id = 2) or ((r.id = c.resource_id and c.user_id = 2) and c.accepted)` was not DISTINCT. Because each `r.author_id` was being calculated for the cross product of r and c. Ust SELECT DISTINCT for fix. Was 12 rows, now 6.https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18988467/sql-query-returning-duplicate-rows





version history - we initially had a `draft` field realised that we wanted to sort different based on published at. so we got rid of `draft` and had a `published_at` nullable field. "The SQL standard does not explicitly define a default sort order for Nulls" - https://knowledgebase.progress.com/articles/Article/How-to-control-the-sort-order-for-NULL-values-with-the-DataServer - we discovered!!! we found that we could use `ORDER BY DESC NULLS FIRST`. and multiple `order by` clauses on one. so we can float unpublished to the top (and sort those by when they were most recently updated), and sort all the published ones by their publish date descending (rather than the date they were updated). one problem we encountered in the draft refactor was that we had to change our conditional inserts - https://github.com/Masterminds/squirrel/issues/239#issuecomment-603479602 - we had columns(...., “draft”) values(...., input.Draft0. Now we had to find a way to insert NULL if draft was true, and to insert the current time if draft was false. The first half is easy, we just use a pq.NullTime{} object. But for the second bit we don’t want to generate that time client-side or even in the backend API, because the API in some odd scenarios could be in a different timezone than the SQL server. Or the time could have drifted a bit. We use the about squirrel link to set the value based on an expression. sq.Expr(“now()”).
Then we use https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.5/dml-returning.html returning data from modified rows to get that ID and date afterwards
