<!-- # Authentication

#### Our frontend

manages authentication through the `AuthModule` class.

This class:

- declares:
    - `LoginComponent`: provides a login form
    - `LoginPageComponent`: a page containing just the `LoginComponenet`
    - `RegisterPageComponent`: a page with a registration form
- imports:
    - `FormsModule`: allows us to build forms declaratively
    - `ReactiveFormsModule`: provides "a model-driven approach to handling form inputs whose values change over time" [@AngularReactiveForms]
    - `RouterModule`

#### Our backend

implements authentication as middleware.

All authenticated administrators should be able to access the following entities:

-   resources - unpublished resources, suspended resources
-   packages - draft packages -->
