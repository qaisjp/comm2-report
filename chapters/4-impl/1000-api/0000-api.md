## Versioning

(rooted at `/v1/`)

## Consuming our own API

For the following reasons, our frontend uses MTA Hub's own public API wherever possible:

- It will ensure we "spend the time to architect and proof out an API that will stay around for a while" and prevent us from "updating the API frequently" [@eversShouldWebsiteUse2012].
- Dante says "Unless the performance overhead of using the web service is an issue, you should definitely use your public API. This will help you get a consistent behavior between your application and the consumers. It will also avoid code duplication [...]" [@danteArchitectureHowMy2013]

Since our API is REST-compliant and the endpoints are organised specific to _entities_, and not to specific webpages on the frontend, some webpages on the frontend will need to make multiple requests to MTA Hub's API to display all the information necessary.

Making multiple API requests can cause a webpage to take a while to load. For example, to fetch the user's profile we would need to first request `/v1/users/qaisjp` to check that the user exists and get their basic information, and then query `/v1/users/qaisjp/resources` to list their resources.

To avoid making extra requests and to improve performance, we have chosen implement a number of _private_ endpoints for internal use only. This will allow us to "make data access more performant by using the database directly instead of doing extra requests" [@virkkunenApiDesignIt2010]. These internal endpoints live at `/private/` instead of the regular `/v1/` prefix, discouraging those that reverse engineer our webapp from building software using these endpoints.
