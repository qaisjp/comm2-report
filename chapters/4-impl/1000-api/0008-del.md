<!-- ## Deletions

A common approach to deleting entities in webapps is
to set an `is_deleted` flag to `true` and simply hide the row from
output.

This is useful if we need to maintain an audit log or (considering that
deletions are destructive) would like to undo changes.

Users, however, may not appreciate a website holding onto data they've
requested to be deleted.

When deleting _resources_ we can just run an SQL query like `delete from resources where resource_id = ?`
and let PostgreSQL cascade this via foreign keys.

Doing this for users raises the following questions:

1. When the user requests a deletion, their comments should be anonymised instead of outright removed (: why?)
2. When an admin deletes the account, the admin should decide whether or not their comments should be removed too. This allows admins to easily purge content from spammers.
3. What if an admin  post-comment-retaining-deletion, that
    their posts should have indeed been deleted?

() Deletions could:

- For comments and bans, allow `author_id` to be nullable. Show `[deleted]` in place.
    - This means we lose track of who the author was.
    - Reddit does this.
- When deleting user accounts, delete all the associated data, but keep the user row, and set `is_deleted` to true. We should also remove all personal data.
    - We also need to litter `if user.is_deleted then` everywhere

This is in line with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) as only personally identifiable information needs to be removed. Comments do not contain sensitive data, and do not fall under the GDPR. -->
