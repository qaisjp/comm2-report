# Existing APIs

We evaluated existing APIs and decided to adopt a REST architectural style in designing our API.

## GitHub

API design is inspired from GitHub's Rest API v3.
https://developer.github.com/v3/

GitHub also have a GraphQL API (v4) which is pretty damn good.

This is a good RESTful API, however it is not the API that the GitHub website itself uses.

## Facebook

Facebook does x

## Twitter

Twitter does y
