# Successful websites and their APIs {#sec:bg-api-analysis}

In this section we analyse a number of successful websites and their APIs. Some of these are software repositories, but not necessarily all of them.

We discuss a number of the following features for each site:

- **API** Does the website have an API?
    - **Architecture.** Is the API and/or website RESTful? What is the URL scheme like?
    - **Use of public APIs.** Does it use its own public API?
- **Public access?** Does the API and/or website allow public access?
- **PWA.** Is the website a progressive web application?
- **Naming / scoping.** How does the system handle name clashes?

Decisions throughout this report will call back to these discussions.

## github.com

GitHub has two main APIs, [REST API v3] and [GraphQL API v4], in addition to supporting "[webhooks](https://developer.github.com/webhooks/)".

Their documentation describes why GitHub uses GraphQL[^why-graphql]:

> GitHub chose GraphQL for our API v4 because it offers significantly more flexibility for our integrators. The ability to define precisely the data you want—and only the data you want—is a powerful advantage over the REST API v3 endpoints. GraphQL lets you replace multiple REST requests with a single call to fetch the data you specify.

[REST API v3]: https://developer.github.com/v3/
[GraphQL API v4]: https://developer.github.com/v4/
[^why-graphql]: GitHub. https://developer.github.com/v4/#why-github-is-using-graphql. Accessed 28 Jan 2020.

GitHub also provides GitHub Package Registry, as well as an "Actions Marketplace".

## gitlab.com

## bitbucket.org

## npmjs.com

Example page https://www.npmjs.com/package/leftpad

Does not use its own public API, but actually uses GitHub's API to fetch and display the number of open issues and pull requests.

## crates.io

crates.io is a progressive web application (or a single page application? TODO) that uses the [Ember.js](https://emberjs.com/) web framework.

It uses its own public API which is available at https://crates.io/api.

Statistics at https://crates.io/api/v1/summary

Search query for "lastfm" - https://crates.io/api/v1/crates?page=1&per_page=10&q=lastfm - we can talk about pagination here too.

TODO Clicking on the "rustfm" package triggers the following calls:

- https://crates.io/api/v1/crates/rustfm
- https://docs.rs/crate/rustfm/0.1.2/builds.json (external?)
- https://crates.io/api/v1/crates/rustfm/versions
- https://crates.io/api/v1/crates/rustfm/0.1.2/authors
- https://crates.io/api/v1/crates/rustfm/owner_user
- https://crates.io/api/v1/crates/rustfm/owner_team
- https://crates.io/api/v1/crates/rustfm/0.1.2/dependencies
- https://crates.io/api/v1/crates/rustfm/downloads

Many requests! Takes a second or so for data to appear and there's sometimes a pop-in effect. This is because requests are not clumped together.

There are also some private endpoints:

- `DELETE https://crates.io/api/private/session` to log out of the website
- `GET /api/private/session/begin` to start logging in (using GitHub Oauth)
- `GET /api/private/session/authorize?code=<code>&state=<state>` to attempt a login using GitHub OAuth, which returns a JSON

## pypi.org

Example page https://pypi.org/project/alive-progress/

Does not use its own public API. Accesses GitHub's public unauthenticated API to fetch and display statistics like number of stars, forks, and open issues / pull requests.

Uses an internal API to fetch dynamic information. Each endpoint provides HTML code that is transcluded into the page to:

- show the available dropdown items depending on who is logged in - https://pypi.org/_includes/current-user-indicator/
- present persistent notifications that can be dismissed - https://pypi.org/_includes/session-notifications/
- present contextual alerts (warnings, errors, success messages and other info) - https://pypi.org/_includes/flash-messages/

The public API is https://warehouse.readthedocs.io/api-reference/ and these endpoints aren't used on the website.

JSON endpoints include:

- retrieving metadata and other info about an individual project - https://warehouse.readthedocs.io/api-reference/stats/#get--stats-
- retrieving metadata and other info about a specific version of an individual project - https://warehouse.readthedocs.io/api-reference/json/#get--pypi--project_name---version--json
- retrieving stats: total size of all packages, and size of top packages - https://warehouse.readthedocs.io/api-reference/stats/#get--stats-
